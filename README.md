## Digital Detectives Assignment 4

For the Digital Detectives Assignment 4, we were asked to create a website using GitHub pages. This website has to include at least one paragraph describing the individual final project plan, which was written for Assignment 3. Furthermore, the site has to contain at least one image and a JavaScript snippet. This page will hopefully show my success with GitHub Pages. 

### Project Concept: Developing an RPG Game

  For the final project that is due, I am planning on doing something that I have not done for a project before. For Hacking the Humanities last semester, I worked with QGIS and Python 3 in order to make some visualizations. For Special Topics I created a website using Python 3 for text mining, and Gephi for the creation of a visualization. Thus, regarding this final project, it seemed interesting to me to learn something new in order to create a different kind of final project, which would be a video game. There are a few questions that come in mind when thinking of creating a video game: What is the topic of the video game and what would be the exact concept? What kind of video game is it? How do I make this, and using what software? 
	  My thoughts now are set on making an RPG game that incorporates detective stories. On the website digitaltrends.com I found recommendations and reviews on software that is used to create games. Firstly, one of the software recommendations includes RPG Maker VX Ace. According to the official RPG Maker website, Ace has some interesting features that will help create a great game: “an enhanced map editor to build your world, a character/enemy/skill/ equipment database with a new, powerful flexible features system, new event options, and expanded default resources” (http://www.rpgmakerweb.com/products/programs/rpg-maker-vx). The only negative side of this software, at least to me, is that it is quite costly, while I am looking for a cheap way to build a game. However, RPG Maker VX Ace Lite allows you to create RPG Games for free, but it is rather limited as to what you can do. Another software that is recommended is IG Maker. IG Maker “takes RPG Maker’s template format and simple user interface and applies them to different genres” (digitaltrends.com).  According to digitaltrends.com IG Maker is very flexible regarding visuals and gameplay, but limited regarding other aspects. This software is very costly as well, thus I am not sure whether I am going to use it or not. 
	  For the next stage of developing a final project, I need to think of an exact concept for the game I would like to create, and select the right software to do this. Therefore, it is necessary to look more into software recommendations on various websites.
